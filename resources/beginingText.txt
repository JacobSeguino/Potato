  You are a halfling, just trying to exist meanwhile, the Dark Lord rampages across the world.

                               You do not care about this. 
  
  You are trying to farm potatoes, because what could a halfling possibly do about it anyway...

The Goal of this game is to get 10 Potatoes before you get 10 Destiny, or 10 Orcs
